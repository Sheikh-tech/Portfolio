        <div class="about-content">
            <p class="style-17">Amid the national excitement around AI, I collaborated with a team of university professors and government contractors to build an AI Agent on the classic wargame Diplomacy.
            Wargaming is a critical focus for both public and private organizations who dedicate extensive resources to strategies, trends, and tactics in the field. DARPA launched the SHADE program in 2021 to develop U.S. diplomatic techniques through simulated environments.

        </div><h1 class="style-29">Gameplay Overview</h1>
         <p class="style-17">Created in 1954 by Allan B. Calhamer, Diplomacy is a virtual game with a relatively small player base of approximately 2,500 active players. Games accommodate 7 players, each choosing a major power in 20th century Europe. Players move units into rival countries to occupy supply centers. The objective of the game is to own a majority (18/34) of the supply centers available on the board. Diplomacy is designed to require players to collaborate, collude, and deceive one another to win. Players rely on trust and negotiation skills to navigate these complex social interactions. Games typically last anywhere from 6-12 hours. For this project we allotted a maximum of 6 hours of gameplay for players. Our schedule was broken down as such:

        </section>



        <p class="style-17">Throughout the game, players were asked to complete a survey. After each season (Spring or Autumn), they were asked to share their thoughts on in-game strategies and rank their level of trust in opposing players. Players were compensated for their participation and all data collected remained pseudonymous. Data was associated with player tags but was not linked to any personal information.

        <h1 class="style-29">The Next Generation of Wargaming</h1>
            <p class="style-17">Phase 1 concluded with the successful collection of data, paving the way for the development of an AI agent. Going into phase 2, our team proposed several innovative methods and modifications to existing frameworks to improve the wargaming experience for diplomats-in-training in multi-party interactions.
            Wargaming in an educational setting often includes tabletop exercises with complex scenarios presented to aspiring diplomats. Diplomatic strategy and foreign policy often require individuals to facilitate peace agreements, secure military advantages, and negotiate strategic alliances. Wargames provide the ideal sandbox environment for trainees to experiment with new approaches and strategies in simulated national conflicts — without having to face the real-world consequences of their decisions. I examined other forms of wargames and tabletop exercises to better understand the frameworks used to train diplomats.

             <h1 class="style-29">Agent Personalities</h1>
             <p class="style-17">MegaGames are multi-player games that blend role-playing and diplomacy. 
                Similar to wargames, MegaGames are large-scale simulations played on tabletop boards and require players to interact with other teams in the game. 
                While these environments are far more complex than games like Diplomacy, the underlying negotiation tactics and diplomatic strategies are highly valued. 
                Oftentimes, MegaGames feature advisor roles played by one player who is allowed to share input with both teams to assist them in reaching an objective. 
                Our group identified the possibility of implementing a similar concept in Phase 2 of the project. 
                The agent would have several personalities to pick from, ranging from ancient philosophers to presidents. 
                The agent would then act as the personality for the duration of the Diplomacy game, or other simulated diplomatic scenarios. 
                This would create a unique dynamic for the players, or diplomats, where the gameplay and style of negotiation would change every time. 
                This variation challenges players to improve and adapt their skills in multiple scenarios. </p>

        <h1 class="style-29">Conclusion</h1>
    
    <p  class="style-17"><ul class="listo-new2">
        <li>Phase 2 of the project was expected to start approximately three months after the end of Phase 1 with the launch of an AI agent capable of negotiation techniques. Ultimately, DARPA chose not to pursue the project any further.
        </li>
        <li>The introduction of social psychology to artificial intelligence is quite complex and requires further research to understand and improve agent capabilities. 
        </li>
         <li>The future of artificial intelligence agents and wargaming lies in the development of AI’s ability to mimic human behavior and decision-making.          </li>
