        <h1 class="style-23">Investigating Blockchain Fraudulent Activity</h1>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p class="style-17">Due to the constant scrutiny of digital asset markets, driven by a lack of regulation and reports of bad actors, a student-led team initiated an investigation into fraudulent activities within the industry. 
                Rug pulls, honeypots, wash trading, and pump-and-dump schemes are all terms used to describe fraudulent activity within the digital asset markets. Our team researched and analyzed several of these schemes and the mechanisms behind them.

                  <h1 class="style-29">My Role</h1>

            <p class="style-17"> I worked alongside other students to process and interpret large blockchain datasets sourced from block explorers. Blockchain datasets are divided into pages containing 25 transactions each, requiring our team to comb through hundreds of transactions and record information throughout the process. I was responsible for: 
            <ul class="listo-new2">
                <li>Scraping and analyzing large datasets</li>
            <li>Processing and charting networks of data</li>
            <li>Documenting and evaluating findings</li>
        </ul>  </div>

            <ul class="listo-new"><p>
                <li>Block Explorers (i.e. BscScan)</li>

                <li>Network Analysis Tool (Gephi)</li>
            </ul></p>
            
                <h1 class="style-29">Methodology</h1></div> 
    <p class="style-17">Based on the outlined criteria, our team created a Python algorithm tailored to this project. The algorithm processes on-chain data linked to wallet addresses, which is then cross-referenced with block explorers for accuracy.
Transactions were flagged and digital wallet addresses were marked if they exhibited any of the following patterns:
    </p>

   <ul class="listo">
    <li>Repeated transfers of value occurring at regular time intervals</li>
<li>Contracts with a high volume of transactions involving minimal amounts of BNB (e.g., ~0.05BNB)</li>
<li>Large-value transactions (10,000 USD) entering or leaving contracts</li>
</ul> </div>

<section class="section"><p class="style-17">Transactions are then exported to Gephi where the data can be visualized on a directed network graph for deeper analysis. In this image, there is a network of wallets, indicated by the colored nodes, showing Binance Coin (BNB) movements from the NANORACA token origin or deployer wallet. Each green node represents a wallet that receives the bulk of BNB transferred between contracts. The green nodes distribute BNB to approximately 20 different wallets (indicated by the clear colored nodes) at each depth, or layer, from the red origin node.

        <p class="style-17">Upon analyzing the blockchain contract code, we identified suspicious functions that are improperly modifying the contract's transactional logic. Additionally, purchasers of the token are unable to sell it on exchanges, suggesting that this contract is a honeypot scam. In this scenario, investors deposit their funds but are unable to withdraw them.

        <div class="listo">
            <p class="style-17">After concluding our investigation into NANORACA, we examined a new token exhibiting similar patterns. Following the same criteria, we found the GALAs token with several questionable transactions and irregularities.
                Digital wallets were promptly reviewed, and the blockchain contract code was examined for any signs of fraudulent or malicious activity. Transactions and contract interactions were visually mapped, revealing a complex network of likely automated processes.

        <section class="image-container"></section> <!--Filler for space-->
        <p class="style-17"> The GALAs contract shows similar honeypot functions similar to those found in other scam contracts, however, the transaction network suggests a level of sophistication beyond a simple scam. 
            Blacklisting is a common and useful tactic for many tokens, however, it is often used nefariously in order to honeypot the buyers of the token.
            Based on our findings, it is clear that the interactions with multipleBotlistAddress are intended to block multiple addresses from trading the token.
            Given the blacklisting capabilities in the contract and a lack of transparency from the developers, the contract is likely preventing buyers from selling their tokens after purchasing them (often referred to as a honeypot).
