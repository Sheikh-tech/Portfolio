        <div class="about-content">
            <p class="style-17">In the Spring of 2024, I collaborated with a team of 4 other students to improve and implement a new content marketing strategy for United Wheels, a multinational holding company of outdoor biking brands. 
                I directed product design efforts from ideation to prototyping, focusing on addressing the needs of a niche target market in the United States.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="style-17">Our team worked on:
                    <ul class = "listo-new2">
               <li>Custom marketing materials specifically designed for the target market</li>
               <li>Improving loyalty programs to increase customer engagement and brand awareness</li>
               <li>Marketing campaigns focused on building trust and credibility with a new audience</li>
            </p></ul></div></section>

        </div><h1 class="style-29">Problem</h1> <p class="style-17"> United Wheels has a strong presence in the classic bicycle market, reaching several markets with its established retail partnerships. Their longstanding relationships with household retailers has driven their sales and brand loyalty for decades. Despite their success, United Wheels wanted to market a new product line of electric bikes targeting a new segment of customers. 
        
            <section class="image-container"></section> <!--Filler for space-->
                <div><h1 class="style-29">Approach</h1></div>
    <p class="style-17">  The campaigns were designed to target a specific niche audience in the electric bike industry. The target demographic was vastly different from United Wheels’ traditional customer base. Our team developed a range of multimedia marketing materials designed for both virtual and in-person advertising.
        We identified broad themes and characteristics of the target audience through our customer research and customer personas. Our objective was to build brand loyalty by aligning digital and physical marketing strategies. 
          </p>
          <p class="style-17"> Our team diligently researched the demographic and explored various segments within the market. We collaborated with an adjacent team to collect ethnographic data about the audience and prospective customers. Several team members attended a local event to conduct in-person interviews, aiming to engage with our target audience. United Wheels was pleased to gain valuable insights into the customer base from this experience.

        <p class="style-17">Students distributed surveys to the United Wheels mailing list which provided further insights into the customer demographic. This research provided us with valuable details about our customer demographic. Some of the data included: age, regional location, product preferences, and practical use cases.       </p>

<p class="style-17">After collecting the necessary data from in-person and online sources, our team created personas to represent the individuals within the target market. Personas were regularly updated as additional data was collected.

            <p class="style-17">After understanding our customer audience more, we developed marketing strategies that align well with the customer. We created a sample radio ad, large banner ads, flyers, mailers, and more.            </p>

        <p class="style-17">Additionally, we designed a loyalty rewards program to improve customer engagement and personalize the customer experience. The program would be promoted to customers both digitally, through email campaigns, and physically, with flyers included in packaging. The rewards program revolved around several key features, including but not limited to:
        <ul class="listo">
            <li><b>Tiered membership:</b> Offers customers tiered membership levels to unlock a range of exclusive and personalized rewards</li>
            <li><b>Points System:</b> Earn points as you ride, purchase, or refer new customers</li> 
            <li><b>Special Offers:</b> Gives loyalty program members access to exclusive discounts</li></ul>
