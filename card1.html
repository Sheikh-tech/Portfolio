        <div class="about-content">
            <p class="style-17">Our department leads asked several classes to improve the academic advising system at Miami University, which undergraduate students use to schedule, plan, and organize their academic careers over the course of four years. 
            I led product development and design efforts, resulting in the creation of <i>A Ladder to Success,</i> based on our team's research and brainstorming. </p>

            <h1 class="style-29">Problem</h1>
            <p class="style-17"> Undergraduate students at Miami University experience a lack of personalized academic planning and an absence of mandatory advisor meetings to assist new students with college planning. The current database does not provide students with long-term planning options, and it does not display available courses tailored to the respective student.              </p>

        <h1 class="style-29">Approach</h1></div>
    <p class="style-17"> I collaborated with other students to evaluate and improve the academic advising system at Miami University. Our team relied on brainstorming, research, and interviews to better understand student experiences with the universityâ€™s advising database, Navigate. We interviewed several students and sought feedback from advisors to gain insight into the process from the perspectives of all stakeholders. We identified common themes amongst the students through our research which helped us to reach an effective solution. 
        Many students felt as though the advising framework was not supportive while attending school.

    <section class="section">
        <p class="style-17">After working with students at different stages of their academic journey, we developed a step-by-step guide outlining key steps students should take at different points throughout their college career.

        <p class="style-17">After doing the necessary research, our team prototyped a digital platform which incorporates gamification and emphasizes the advisor-student relationship. The goal was to motivate students and advisors to connect frequently. Our solution highlighted the importance of planning ahead and provided a framework for advisors and students to fill out as they progress through their academic career.

        <h2 class="style-29">Conclusion</h2>
            <ul class="listo-new2">
                <li>Academic tools tend to be dull and often overlook the needs of each individual student. </li>
                <li>Our gamification approach was well received by advisors as they had provided feedback and believed it would be a good alternative to the system we use now. </li> 
                <li>While not every academic plan is the same, we wanted to create something that standardizes the communication process for both the advisor and the student.</li>
